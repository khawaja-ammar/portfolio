#### Personality

I'm an easy going guy who believes strongly in mutual respect and clear communication. I try to avoid any unnecessary drama and complications.

Love thinking and reading up on philosophy while striving to improve myself.

#### How I code

- Performance oriented
- Test Driven Development
- Write readable, maintainable and well structured code
- Break-down the problem into smaller more manageable components
- Make abstractions where necessary
- Try to learn and follow the best practices

#### Approach to work

- Meticulous about removing ambiguity in assigned tasks, will ask questions until I know the exact requirements
- If any ambiguity arises that demands a potentially impactful decision, will disclose and ask the supervisor how they want to tackle it (stating the goods and bad of the approach to the best of my knowledge)
- If I get stuck at something, I spend my free time (beyond the work hours) trying to find the best fix for the issue

#### How I keep up to date as a developer

- Obsidian Knowledge Base: I use Obsidian to take extensive notes on everything that I learn after thoroughly researching it, this has helped my working efficiency many folds
- Twitter: Follow several of the well known and respected programmers in the industry
- Podcasts and blogs related to programming (big fan of Lex Fridman)
- Content creators in programming space
- Experimental projects (like learning Golang and new frameworks) in free time

#### Goals

I would love to work for the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley, I have yet to learn a lot and there is immense room for growth and I would love the reach the pinnacle.

Someday I hope be at the top of the programming game, hopefully contributing something worthwhile to this world. Something that lasts.

#### Activities beyond programming

- Very interested in computer hardware, watch and follow many youtube creators like LinusTechTips and GamersNexus
- Very interested in game development and how game engines works (love Digital Foundry)
- Interested in traveling around the world and expanding my horizons
